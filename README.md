# Motivation
Nowadays, many developer are used to write code, cross-compile it, deploy on target and verify it.
The drawback of this approach is the need for a target hardware, requiring extra cost and effort.
Hence, the idea to start a simple bootloader application for arm that can be fully simulated using qemu emulator.
qemu is a linux emulator that simulated embedded software for various architectures on the x86 windows.
